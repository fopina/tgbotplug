{"name":"TGBotPlug","tagline":"Telegram plugin-based bot","body":"tgbotplug is meant to be an easy-to-extend telegram bot built around [twx.botapi](https://github.com/datamachine/twx.botapi).\r\n\r\nUsing tgbotplug, after choosing/developing your plugins, is as simple as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tgbot\r\ntgbot.TGBot(\r\n  'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN',\r\n  plugins=[\r\n    Plugin1(),\r\n    ...,\r\n    PluginN(),\r\n  ],\r\n).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins should inherit `tgbot.TGPluginBase`and implement `list_commands()` (and the methods mapped in its result).\r\n\r\nPlugin examples can be found in [tgbotplug-plugins](https://github.com/fopina/tgbotplug-plugins).\r\n\r\nAlso, a few full bot examples (using webhooks and prepared to deploy in OpenShift):\r\n* [ButtieBot](https://github.com/fopina/tgbot-buttiebot)\r\n* [PriberamBot](https://github.com/fopina/tgbot-buttiebot)\r\n* [IndieShuffleBot](https://github.com/pmpfl/indieshufflebot)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
